current problems:
1. Variable naming convention: it's better to use camelCase or snake_case instead of using mixed case. For example, PlayerHP should be playerHp, and enemyaccW should be enemyAccW.

2. addText function: Instead of using textarea.value += Game_Text, you can use textarea.innerHTML += Game_Text to add text to a textarea.

3. generateEnemy function:

3.1 In line 30, if enemydmg is equal to 3, you can extract the code inside the if statement and put it in a separate function to make the code more readable and maintainable.
3.2 In line 34, instead of using if (enemydmg === 3 && enemyhp <= 3), you can use an else if statement.
4. Use const instead of let whenever possible. Variables that don't change, such as max_levels, current_level, allowedCommands, and Hit, should be declared as const.

5. Remove unused variables, such as enemyaccW.

6. Replace undefined with null or "" whenever possible. For example, replace GainedLoot = undefined with GainedLoot = "".

7. Refactor the code in the Walk button function. For example, the generateLoot function can be called only when the player escapes or kills the enemy, instead of being called on every walk.

8. The console.log statements can be removed in the final version of the code.
